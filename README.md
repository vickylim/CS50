**pset0: Scratch**  
I thought I would submit pset0 by January 6, 2019, but it took me until March 26, 2019 because I took this pset seriously. I wanted to create a game that I would actually play to cheer myself up, that I could share with my partner, or my friends. 

I started with a few Bitmojis and tried to program a simple dance to the song, ["Let's Dance,"](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/269692318/) but it took me a while to figure out how to navigate between the different backdrops and sprites, then scrapped the idea. Next, I wanted a game where the player would [tuck my mini plush black bear, named Blackberry, into bed](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/278416067/) with a really cute kid voiceover, like how I imagine Bjenny Montero's characters would sound like. This was taking me too long, so I thought I would copycat the Pikachu's Pastry Catch game with one called ["Eat Your Greens"](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/282480608/) in which my Bitmoji would catch vegetables instead, as a reminder of my new year's goal of eating healthier. In my final effort to get this pset done and continue on with the course because I really wanted to watch David Malan's next lecture video, I settled on meeting the minimum requirements with an embarrassing ["Postcard,"](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/297401615/) where the idea is that one day I might return to this "game" and turn it into an interactive poem against the backdrop of a Georgia O'Keefe painting to remember my recent trip to New Mexico.
